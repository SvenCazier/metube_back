This song is called:
"5,000 Candles in the Wind"

00:00:11.523 --> 00:00:16.730
Up in horsey heaven
here's the thing...

00:00:18.063 --> 00:00:23.196
You trade your legs
for angels wings...

00:00:24.538 --> 00:00:29.737
And once we've all said good-bye

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:37.412
You take a running
leap and you learn to fly

00:00:37.724 --> 00:00:42.510
Bye bye Li'l Sebastian

00:00:44.184 --> 00:00:50.370
Miss you in the saddest fashion

00:00:50.677 --> 00:00:55.224
Bye bye Li'l Sebastian

00:00:57.097 --> 00:01:02.264
You're 5,000 candles in the wind

00:01:06.668 --> 00:01:11.754
And though we all
miss you everyday

00:01:13.121 --> 00:01:17.915
We know you're up
there eating heaven's hay

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:24.873
But here's the part
that hurts the most

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.146
Humans cannot ride a ghost

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.590
Bye bye Li'l Sebastian

00:01:39.237 --> 00:01:45.308
Miss you in the saddest fashion

00:01:45.888 --> 00:01:50.748
Bye bye Li'l Sebastian

00:01:52.181 --> 00:01:57.146
You're 5,000 candles in the wind

00:01:57.171 --> 00:01:58.798
Everybody sing it now!

00:01:58.823 --> 00:02:03.605
Bye bye Li'l Sebastian

00:02:05.232 --> 00:02:11.298
Miss you in the saddest fashion

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.511
Bye bye Li'l Sebastian

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.517
You're 5,000
candles in the wind...

00:02:24.766 --> 00:02:29.285
Maybe someday
we'll saddle up again...

00:02:30.726 --> 00:02:37.866
And I know I'll always
miss my horsiest friend...

00:02:41.618 --> 00:02:44.771
Spread your wings and fly...

00:02:44.796 --> 00:02:49.533
Spread your wings and fly...
