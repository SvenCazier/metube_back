00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.801
How long, how long will I slide?

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.509
Separate my side

00:00:32.977 --> 00:00:35.045
I don't

00:00:35.523 --> 00:00:41.318
I don't believe it's bad

00:00:41.943 --> 00:00:46.075
Slittin' my
throat, it's all I ever

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.045
I heard your voice
through a photograph

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.023
I thought it up and
brought up the past

00:00:54.183 --> 00:00:57.131
Once you know you
can never go back

00:00:57.155 --> 00:01:02.116
I gotta take
it on the other side

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.565
Well, centuries are
what it meant to me

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.525
A cemetery where I marry the sea

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.731
A stranger thing could
never change my mind

00:01:14.755 --> 00:01:19.343
I gotta take
it on the other side

00:01:19.376 --> 00:01:22.976
Take it on the other side

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.271
Take it on, take it on

00:01:31.576 --> 00:01:36.350
How long, how long will I slide?

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.030
Separate my side

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.525
I don't

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.078
I don't believe it's bad

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.574
Slittin' my
throat, it's all I ever

00:01:55.074 --> 00:01:58.332
Pour my life into a paper cup

00:01:58.624 --> 00:02:02.326
The ashtray's full and
I'm spillin' my guts

00:02:02.536 --> 00:02:05.503
She wanna
know am I still a slut?

00:02:05.528 --> 00:02:10.191
I've got to take
it on the other side

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:17.818
A scarlet starlet
and she's in my bed

00:02:18.028 --> 00:02:21.890
A candidate for
the soulmate bled

00:02:22.048 --> 00:02:24.828
Push the trigger
and I pull the thread

00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:29.410
I gotta take
it on the other side

00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:33.090
Take it on the other side

00:02:33.243 --> 00:02:39.171
Take it on, take it on

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.986
How long, how long will I slide?

00:02:46.686 --> 00:02:52.156
Separate my side

00:02:52.322 --> 00:02:53.664
I don't

00:02:54.356 --> 00:03:00.285
I don't believe it's bad

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:04.370
Slittin' my
throat, it's all I ever

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.000
Turn me on, take
me for a hard ride

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.911
Burn me out, leave
me on the other side

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.765
I yell and tell
it that it's not my friend

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.211
I tear it down,
I tear it down and then it's born again

00:03:42.402 --> 00:03:47.105
How long, how long will I slide?

00:03:47.396 --> 00:03:52.830
Separate my side

00:03:52.934 --> 00:03:54.735
I don't

00:03:54.967 --> 00:04:00.855
I don't believe it's bad

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:08.190
Slittin' my throat, it's
all I ever had

00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:09.664
I don't

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.295
I don't believe it's bad

00:04:15.975 --> 00:04:21.315
Slittin' my
throat, it's all I ever...
