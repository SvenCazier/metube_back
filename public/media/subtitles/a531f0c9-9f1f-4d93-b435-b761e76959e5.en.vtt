Tonight

00:02:14.023 --> 00:02:16.330
Tonight

00:02:38.648 --> 00:02:44.032
That was about 10 years before Eddie Van
Halen did the same thing to his guitar...

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.432
Well, I played this guitar on
a bunch of songs right there...

00:02:49.573 --> 00:02:54.823
Travelin' Band, Green River,
Up Around the Bend, like that...

00:02:54.848 --> 00:03:00.123
This is the guitar I
played at Woodstock!

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:03.865
That's right!

00:03:05.523 --> 00:03:08.081
Now Woodstock was
kind of a strange deal...

00:03:08.165 --> 00:03:12.698
They call me up in July
of 1969 to play in August...

00:03:12.894 --> 00:03:15.527
And they said: John why
don't you bring Creedence up to

00:03:15.553 --> 00:03:18.552
Woodstock and
play, I said: Great!

00:03:18.644 --> 00:03:21.011
Just give us a
good spot on the bill

00:03:21.094 --> 00:03:25.602
The man says: 9 o'clock,
Saturday night, that's the best spot!

00:03:25.994 --> 00:03:28.677
I said: Alright,
cool, we'll be there.

00:03:28.953 --> 00:03:31.011
What he didn't tell me was...

00:03:31.036 --> 00:03:34.912
You're going to follow
the Greatful Dead.

00:03:40.292 --> 00:03:41.500
Anyway...

00:03:41.967 --> 00:03:45.883
Unbeknownst to me, I arrived
quite innocently on Saturday,

00:03:45.908 --> 00:03:47.950
in the afternoon, looked
around. You know there were

00:03:47.975 --> 00:03:50.783
half a million people
up there, at Woodstock.

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:51.983
So...

00:03:52.008 --> 00:03:55.256
At about 6 o'clock I'm starting to
get kind of nervous because there

00:03:55.281 --> 00:03:59.039
were still 5 more bands that had
to play before the Greatful Dead.

00:03:59.064 --> 00:04:00.706
Well, you guessed it...

00:04:00.856 --> 00:04:05.210
7 o'clock, 8 o'clock, 9 o'clock,
came, and still no Greatful Dead.

00:04:05.235 --> 00:04:08.976
10, 11, the Greatful Dead
finally went on at midnight.

00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:13.677
Playing their jingly-jangly,
tie-dye, rainbowy kind of thing.

00:04:13.984 --> 00:04:15.042
It was cool...

00:04:15.067 --> 00:04:17.684
About 45 minutes and
then they stopped...

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.051
Dead silence.

00:04:19.076 --> 00:04:22.826
Right in the middle of their set.
Nobody knew what had happened.

00:04:23.451 --> 00:04:27.618
Well in 1995 the band fessed
up that what had happened was...

00:04:27.643 --> 00:04:32.967
as they walked on stage at
Woodstock, they all took LSD...

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:35.440
In front of half
a million people.

00:04:36.548 --> 00:04:39.839
Well, anyway, up on stage
it sounded kind of like this:

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.406
Hey Jerry...
- Yeah, man?

00:04:45.207 --> 00:04:47.873
Where's my guitar?

00:04:48.998 --> 00:04:50.623
I don't know, man.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.967
Anyway, after an hour of
silence, they started playing again,

00:04:55.025 --> 00:04:57.259
played another 45 minutes,

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.617
and then were gone.

00:04:58.642 --> 00:05:03.233
I come running out on stage, I'm ready
to rock'n'roll, set the world on fire.

00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:06.383
It was 2:30 in the
morning, people.

00:05:07.257 --> 00:05:10.716
There were a lot of kids right
down here who looked just like me...

00:05:11.049 --> 00:05:12.107
except...

00:05:12.433 --> 00:05:14.083
they were naked...

00:05:14.982 --> 00:05:16.107
and...

00:05:16.382 --> 00:05:18.100
they were asleep...

00:05:18.232 --> 00:05:22.466
The Greatful Dead had
put half a million people...

00:05:22.491 --> 00:05:23.549
to sleep.

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.181
So I commence to rocking and rolling, trying
to get this thing going here, you know...

00:05:28.248 --> 00:05:32.097
Travelin' Band, Good Golly
Miss Molly, Keep on Chooglin'

00:05:32.404 --> 00:05:35.164
It wasn't kind of really moving.
I went up to the mic, I was

00:05:35.188 --> 00:05:37.947
a little frustrated, if you
watch the movie you'll see it.

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:41.822
I said: Well, we're playing
our hearts out up here for ya...

00:05:41.847 --> 00:05:44.423
We just want you
to have a good time.

00:05:44.604 --> 00:05:49.545
Way out there in the darkness,
some lonesome dude...

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.637
one guy, flicking his
light and I hear him say:

00:05:53.662 --> 00:05:58.459
Don't worry about it
John, we're with you.

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:05.068
So I played the whole rest of my
big Woodstock concert for that guy.

00:06:15.366 --> 00:06:18.199

00:06:19.133 --> 00:06:21.319
