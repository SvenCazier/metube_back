00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.765
I wear the black shirt

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.183
Today my love is in mourning

00:01:28.208 --> 00:01:30.251
Today I have a sorrow in my soul

00:01:30.276 --> 00:01:32.903
And it's because of your spell

00:01:33.056 --> 00:01:35.245
Today I know that you no longer love me

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.817
And that's what hurts me the most

00:01:37.842 --> 00:01:39.696
That I wear the black shirt

00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:42.250
And a sorrow that hurts me

00:01:42.275 --> 00:01:44.570
Sadly it seems that I was left alone

00:01:44.595 --> 00:01:46.930
And your lie was completely pure

00:01:46.955 --> 00:01:49.445
What damn bad luck of mine

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.856
that that day I found you

00:01:51.881 --> 00:01:56.495
For drinking the evil
poison of your love

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.296
I was left dying and full of pain

00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:06.177
I breathed in that bitter
smoke of your goodbye

00:02:06.202 --> 00:02:10.483
And since you left I only...

00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:13.738
wear, I wear the black shirt

00:02:13.763 --> 00:02:16.170
Because I have a black soul

00:02:16.195 --> 00:02:20.783
I lost my calm because of you
and almost lost my bed

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.130
Bed, bed, come on baby

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:25.798
I tell you covertly

00:02:25.823 --> 00:02:30.503
I wear the black shirt and
underneath I am deceased

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.890
I wear the black shirt

00:03:08.915 --> 00:03:11.570
Your love doesn't interest me anymore

00:03:11.595 --> 00:03:15.118
What tasted like glory to me
yesterday, today tastes like pure (sh)...

00:03:15.143 --> 00:03:18.290
Wednesday afternoon
and you don't arrive

00:03:18.663 --> 00:03:20.569
Not even showing signs

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.370
And me with the black shirt
and your suitcases at the door

00:03:25.395 --> 00:03:27.663
Sadly it seems that I was left alone

00:03:27.688 --> 00:03:29.996
And your lie was completely pure

00:03:30.021 --> 00:03:32.631
What damn bad luck of mine

00:03:32.656 --> 00:03:34.923
that that day I found you

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:39.696
For drinking the evil
poison of your love

00:03:39.721 --> 00:03:44.463
I was left dying and full of pain

00:03:44.488 --> 00:03:49.203
I breathed in that bitter
smoke of your goodbye

00:03:49.228 --> 00:03:53.557
And since you left, I only

00:03:53.582 --> 00:03:56.566
wear, I wear the black shirt

00:03:56.591 --> 00:03:59.170
Because I have a black soul

00:03:59.223 --> 00:04:04.090
I lost my calm because of you
and almost lost my bed

00:04:04.115 --> 00:04:06.183
Bed, bed, come on baby

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.870
I tell you covertly

00:04:08.895 --> 00:04:13.715
I wear the black shirt and
underneath I am deceased

00:04:13.766 --> 00:04:16.015
I wear the black shirt

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.431
Because I have a black soul

00:04:18.456 --> 00:04:23.270
I lost my calm because of you
and almost lost my bed

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:25.483
Bed, bed, come on baby

00:04:25.508 --> 00:04:28.250
I tell you covertly

00:04:28.275 --> 00:04:32.917
I wear the black shirt and
underneath I am deceased
